# autocomplete

Clojure autocomplete library with coffeescript front-end and Redis
backed.

Based on [Soulmate](https://github.com/seatgeek/soulmate) by Seatgeek.

Demo site will use Noir (most likely).

***Currently extracting it from a [previous project](https://github.com/dmix/documeds), still a work in progress***
